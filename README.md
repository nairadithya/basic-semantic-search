# Basic Semantic Search

This is a search engine built with the [`multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1) model. The model was trained on the [`MAKILINGDING/english_dictionary`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MAKILINGDING/english_dictionary) dataset.

The embeddings generated from this are hosted [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nairadithya/dictionary-embeddings).

## About This Project

This is the project we built for 23MAT204(Mathematics For Intelligent Systems 3). It's a demonstration of a vector search engine, and its ability to capture meaning and relations between words and ideas in ways that weren't obvious, and the numerical algorithms that make this capable of.
